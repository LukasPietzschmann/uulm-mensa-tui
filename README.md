# UULM Mensa TUI
A terminal app implemented with c++ and ncurses for hungry students at the university of ulm.

This app uses the unofficial API from [Kai Anter](https://github.com/Tanikai/).
If you don't like terminals, you can also see the current meal plan at [Kai's webpage](https://mensaplan.anter.dev/).
