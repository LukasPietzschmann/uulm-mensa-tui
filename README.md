# UULM Mensa TUI
A terminal app implemented with c++ and ncurses for hungry students at the university of ulm.

This app uses the unofficial API from [Kai Anter](https://github.com/Tanikai/).
If you don't value unoccupied RAM and insist of using a Web-App for literally everything, you can also use [Kai's webpage](https://mensaplan.anter.dev/).
